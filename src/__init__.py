Cell Fate Decision Modeling with Neural Networks

⚠️  IMPORTANT FOR AI ASSISTANTS: Always check STATUS.md in the project root 
    to understand the current implementation phase and progress before making changes.

This package provides tools for simulating cell fate decisions in a 1D system
where gene regulatory networks are represented by trainable neural networks.

Modules:
    dynamics: Core simulation functions for cell state evolution
    neural_network: Neural network architecture using Flax
    cost_function: Information-theoretic cost function for training
    utils: Helper functions for visualization and analysis
